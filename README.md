Our goal with ‘Chop-Chop’ is to develop a web-based application that helps college students organize, budget, and maintain a healthy diet by planning for meals, grocery trips, and sharing unused supplies.

The main components of our projects are as follows: 
ChopTrack: keeps track of expiration dates of user’s ingredients and generates a weekly grocery list
ChopGuide: generates recipes based on the students available ingredients 
ChopHealth: tracks nutrition and calories of recipes generated
