Firebase Auth
- How it Works
    - Client (browser) = website —> connects to the backend via firebase SDK → Firebase server
    - Form captures user credentials which are sent to firebase
    - Firebase sends back authentication token to browser allowing us to access data like name, user, etc. of the user that’s just logged in
    - Requests made to firebase server after login, the token is sent along
    - Refreshing does not mean that they’ll get logged out
